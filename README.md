## DSA Python Coding Exercises

This repository contains Python code for various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) exercises. 

### Getting Started

This repository assumes you have Python installed on your system. You can check by running `python --version` in your terminal. 

**Running Exercises:**

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/davechemwetich/DSA-Python-Codes.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd DSA-Python-Codes
```

3. Each exercise might be in a separate file or folder. Locate the file containing the code you want to run.

4. Run the Python script using the following command in your terminal, replacing `<filename>.py` with the actual filename:

```
python <filename>.py
```

**Example:**

```
python linked_list.py
```

This will execute the code in the `linked_list.py` file and print the results (assuming that's what the code is designed to do).


### Contributing

* Include clear comments explaining the code and the data structure/algorithm being implemented.
* Ensure the code is well-formatted and easy to read.
* Consider adding unit tests to ensure your code works as expected (optional but encouraged).
